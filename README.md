# Install instructions

1) To install this mod, you must create a folder called "custom" in the root of your insurgency directory (insurgency/insurgency2, the folder where your "cfg" and "maps" and "html" and "expressions" folders are located for insurgency)
2) Inside of the "custom" folder that you created, you must create a SOCOMINS folder.
3) After you have created the SOCOMINS folder, you must extract the files and folders from this package (the folders "maps" and "models" and "materials" etc all of those folders) to your "custom" folder so that it looks something like this:![install_folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33754783/141179259-449f9481-5bde-47a5-be8a-f63ddcf6fefb.png)
4) If you followed these instructions, install is now complete and you can play the mod by loading up Insurgency. It is recommended to play against AI in the solo "multiplayer modes" since this mod has weapons speific for multiplayer.
